### <a name="project-overview"></a>Project Overview

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

### <a name="code"></a>Code

All of the code is provided in the Jupyter notebook `smartcab.ipynb`. 

#### Note: 
The improved Q-learning simulation showed that both the safety and the reliability rating are both A+.
